ðŸ“Œ Regional & Demographic Insights â€“ Loan distribution by state, employment length, purpose, homeownership, and term.
ðŸ“Œ Data Accuracy â€“ Ensuring data integrity through SQL queries and Tableau dashboards.
Objectives
âœ” Improve loan approval strategies
âœ” Optimize risk management practices
âœ” Identify profitable lending opportunities
âœ” Reduce bad loans and enhance portfolio quality
